> The default starter for [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org), with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and PurgeCSS installed to start without struggling with setup.

Tailwind CSS and PurgeCSS Config following [Brandon's post](https://www.brandonpittman.net/tailwind-purge-config/).

I'd like to thank [Cosmin](https://github.com/cossssmin) and [Brandon](https://github.com/brandonpittman) who helped me understand the whole setup and make it work correctly.

I hope this starter will help beginners like me getting started easily with Gridsome and Tailwind CSS.

It's my very first time using Github to share a repo so don't hesitate to tell me if there is something wrong here.

## Instructions

### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Create a Gridsome project

It's recommended that you install this starter with the gridsome create command, so that Gridsome removes the .git folder and installs NPM dependencies for you:

1. `gridsome create my-gridsome-site https://github.com/willdante/gridsome-starter-tailwind-purgecss.git` to install the starter </li>
2. `cd my-gridsome-site` to open folder
3. `gridsome develop` to start local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
4. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ
